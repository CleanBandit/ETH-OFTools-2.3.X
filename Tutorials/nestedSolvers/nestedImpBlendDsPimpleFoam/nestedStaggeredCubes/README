nestedStaggeredCubes

Example of one-way, downscale, nested simulation. nestedImpBlendDsPimpleFoam is 
used as solver. The nesting is of type LES-within-LES. This 

A nested case is composed of two cases: a master case (mst) and a nested
case (ntd). Each case is a standard OpenFOAM case. Each case has a extra file
in the folder system: nestingControlDict. It holds all the informations
needed to achived the nesting.

    
Run the case:
    Simply run the script 'runAll.sh' in mst. As it is an LES, the run is long.
    
Post-processing with paravirw 4.3.1 (or later):
    1. Open paraview 4.3.1 (or later) in the mst folder.
    2. Open the case nestedCase.foam located in the folder mst. In the left 
       panel, under "Mesh Regions", mark all the entries (internalMesh, inlet, ... , 
       ntd/internalMesh, ntd/inlet). If you don't have the entries "ntd/.." run
       the tool foamMakeNestedSymLink.py
    3. Extract the block mst with "Filters/Alphabetical/Extract Block"
    4. Extract the block ntd with "Filters/Alphabetical/Extract Block"
    5. Do the processing for each case of the nesting under the relevant extracted
       block.
